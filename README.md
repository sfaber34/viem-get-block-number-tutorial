# viem-get-block-number-tutorial
This tutorial is a quickstart guide for how to use [viem](https://viem.sh/) to get the block number from your local BG node.

## Environmental Setup ðŸ“š

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)


## Project Setup ðŸ“š

Run the following commands to initialize a new yarn project. 

```sh
mkdir viemScripts
cd viemScripts
yarn init -y
```


Now run this line to add the viem package to your yarn project.

```sh
yarn add viem
```


Create a new file in the root of your project called `getBlockNumber.js`. You can do that within your text editor or if you're fancy, run this:

```sh
touch getBlockNumber.js
```


## Writing the Script ðŸ“š

Now we're ready to start adding code! Open `getBlockNumber.js` and add this line to the top of the file to import viem:

```js
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
```


OK, now we need to add a viem client to connect with your BG node. You will need to check the upper-right corner of the BG Client terminal dashboard to find the local IP address of your BG client. This snippet tells the script to connect to our BG node at local IP: 192.168.1.42 (yours will differ). It's using port 8545, which is the default port for execution layer client RPC traffic.

```js
const client = createPublicClient({
  transport: http("http://192.168.1.42:8545"),
});
```

If your node is running on the same machine as your script, you can use the following with `localhost` acting as an alias for your local IP address:

```js
const client = createPublicClient({
  transport: http("http://localhost:8545"),
});
```


Next, let's add a function to get the block number from our local node and print it to the console.

```js
async function getBlockNumber() {
  try {
    const blockNumber = await client.getBlockNumber();
    console.log("ðŸ“¦ blocknumber:", blockNumber);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching block number:", error);
  }
}
```


And there's one last edit to make to our script. Let's add a line to call our function at the end of the file.

```js
getBlockNumber();
```

Alright, the full script should look like this:

```js
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem";

const client = createPublicClient({
  transport: http("http://192.168.1.42:8545"),
});

async function getBlockNumber() {
  try {
    const blockNumber = await client.getBlockNumber();
    console.log("ðŸ“¦ blocknumber:", blockNumber);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching block number:", error);
  }
}

getBlockNumber();
```
> Just make sure to replace the client transport IP address with your own BG client's local IP address (or `http://localhost:8545` if your script and node are on the same machine).


Now there's just one more housekeeping task to do before we can run our script. We need to tell Node.js to treat our script as a module. Open up `package.json` and add `"type": "module"` to the end of the viemScripts object so that it looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "viemScripts",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "viem": "^2.21.28"
  },
  "type": "module"
}
```

## Running your Get Block Number Script ðŸ“š

Run this to execute your script:

```sh
node getBlockNumber.js
```

You should see the following output:

```sh
ðŸ“¦ blocknumber: 20986305n
```

Not too bad for a few lines of code!
